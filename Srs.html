<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h1><b>1. Introduction</b></h1>
<a name="Purpose"></a>
<h3>i. Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to give the developers and owners an overview of how the system will function. This is the first version of the document and it has been written before any code or changes to the code. This document contains details regarding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Application of the software.</li>
  <li>Functionality of the software.</li>
  <li>Users and classes.</li>
  <li>System Constraints</li>
</ul>

<a name="Document Conventions">
<h3>ii. Document Conventions</h3>
<p>The SRS was written using the Arial (san-serif) font. Any emphasis on keywords will be mentioned by bold lettering and sentences by italics. Tables will be provided whenever there is a need for comparisons.</p>
</a>

<a name="Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions"></a>
<h3>iii. Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
<p>This document is intended to help act as a guideline for the developers working on the project and keeping track of all the necessary information that is to be implemented in the project. This document will also help the owning organization to get basic ideas on the functionality of the project.

  Chapter 2 of this document contains details of the project functions, users and classes, operating environment, user documentations etc.

  Chapter 3 contains details regarding the external interface requirements, user interfaces, hardware interfaces.

  Chapter 4 discusses the system features and Chapter 5 talks about all the non functional requirements.
  </p>

<a name="Product Scope"></a>
<h3>iv. Product Scope</h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to digitize the existing documents of the organization so that files can be searched and retrieved digitally. Files are also automatically archived upon a set expiry date. The admin users can assign specific folders to certain groups of users and users also have the option to set folders to either public or private status. The system will provide a user friendly navigation bar to help guide the users through the entire system.</p>

 <h3>i. Product Perspective</h3>
<p>The application will be a web based document digitization service. Employees will upload scanned documents through the web interface or the android application.. To access the files the user must log in to a web application on his/her computer using a web browser. In order to access any of these features the user must create an account and login to that account. Employees will also be allowed to login via google login. Accounts being created must be verified by the admin. Admins are the super Employees of the system, they can assign roles and create groups for Employees and folders.

A user can upload files and keep them in folders. Folders can be public and private. Contents belonging in public folders will be available for everyone on the system. Employees can search for a file using keyword searches or OCR.Upon reaching the expiry date, the system will automatically archive the files.</p>

<a name="User Classes and Characteristics"></a>
<h3>iii. User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
<p>Employee- A user who is employed by the organization and holds a title below executive or head of department. Can upload and search for files in all public folders. Can only access files from private folders that they are given passwords to. This user can also create public and private folders.

System Administrator - A user who the organizer promotes to oversee every operation in the system. This user can view every file in all public and private folders. This user can also assign other employees to particular groups and give them access to specific folders. A system administrator is also responsible to confirm authentication on new users to the system.
</p>

<a name="Operating Environment"></a>
<h3>iv.  Operating Environment</h3>
<p>The entire system is going to exist on a web application and there will also be an android application. To access the application user must ensure that he/she has access to a computer or mobile device and that internet access. </p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<h3>i.  User Interfaces</h3>
<p>Users will be greeted by a sign-in page where he/she can either sign-in or create a new account. If the user successfully enters the login credentials he/she will be taken to the user dashboard. If the user is new then they must create a new account and then login if the system administrator grants the access.
Once signed in, the user is greeted to a dashboard. The dashboard will help navigate the user throughout the entire system where they can add,store and view files in different folders both public and private. </p>
<br>

<a name="Hardware Interfaces"></a>
<h3>ii. Hardware Interfaces</h3>
<p>For the hardware interfaces, as the system is being developed as a web application and mobile application there are no restrictions to access the web application but the mobile application is only being developed for the Android OS.
It is also expected that the user will have a general idea on how to use the mobile device camera as the mobile app will use it to scan documents.
</p>
<br>
<a name="Software Interfaces"></a>
<h3>iii. Software Interfaces</h3>
<p>For the web application part we’ll be using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the mobile version on the app, we’ll be using android</p>
